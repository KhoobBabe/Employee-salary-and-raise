# Employee-salary-and-raise

A class called Employee is created that includes three instance variables—a first name (type String), a last name (type String) and a monthly salary (double).
A constructor is made that initializes the three variables.
If, monthly salary provided by the user is not positive, it should be set to 0 instead.

The test application named EmployeeTest demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Two Employee objects are created and each object’s yearly salary is displayed. Then each Employee is given a 10% raise and each Employee’s yearly salary is displayed again.
